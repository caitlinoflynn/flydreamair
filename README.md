# FlyDreamAir Frequent Flyer System

The FlyDreamAir Frequent Flyer Program allows users to register and accumulate frequent flyer points, which can be redeemed for discount vouchers on future flights. The system is overseen by multiple administrators who manage user records such as bookings and vouchers, and handle customer inquiries.

This project serves as an assessment deliverable for the CSIT214: IT Project Management course at the University of Wollongong.
